# minimal-diffusion-mnist
When you first learn a complex topic like Diffusion Models, you should always start by breaking it down into its easiest pieces to really understand the underlying concepts. 
Unfortunately, a lot of implementations of Diffusion Models on Github are quite complex and structured into a lot of files which makes approaching them quite hard. 
This is why I decided to implement a model which is as minimal as possible while still being able to generate image data; all in one single notebook.
